            Hello! It's nice to meet you. My name is Nishi Patel, and I am a Northeastern 
            University alum with a Bachelors Degree in Data Science & Physics, 
            and a minor in Mathematics. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I am currently looking to pursue a career in Software Development and Engineering, 
            and have past experiences working as a Data Analyst intern at companies such as 
            STAG Industrial and Pratt & Whitney.
            <br>
            <br>
            Throughout college, I participated in co-ops, clubs, and different activites that helped
            me to learn more about data science and physics, as well as fuel my passions throughout other hobbies.
            From my experiences, my biggest takeaway is that I want to pursue a career that allows 
            me to help other people by creating useful tools, while also being enviromentally mindful
            of my actions.
        </p>
