            Hello! It's nice to meet you. My name is Nishi Patel, and I am a Northeastern 
            University alum with a Bachelors Degree in Data Science & Physics, 
            with a minor in Mathematics. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I am currently looking to pursue a career in Software Development and Engineering, 
            and have past experiences working as a Data Analyst intern at companies such as 
            STAG Industrial and Pratt & Whitney.
            <br>
            <br>
            Throughout college, I participated in co-ops, clubs, and different activites that helped
            me to learn more about data science, as well as fuel my passions throughout other hobbies.
            From my experiences, my biggest takeaway is that I want to pursue a career that allows 
            me to help other people by creating useful tools, while also being enviromentally mindful
            of my actions.
        </p>
