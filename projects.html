											<p>I am currently working on a project to build an online portfolio for Keya Saxena and Rose Knopper, both film graduates from NYU Tisch School of the Arts. 
                                                The website showcases works created by the two under the name of their production company, Junk Flower Films. This website was built entirely in GitHub using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is an ongoing project as the two create more works.</p>

												<h2>Building a Personal Website</h2>

											<p>In January of 2025, I decided to build my personal website from scratch while using HTML and CSS. The version currently seen is hosted on GitHub, and is an ongoing project. In the future, I hope to utilize React to create a more interactive website, as well as add more features to my resume page. This project allowed me to delve into web development, and inspired me to work on my current Junk Flower Films website.</p>

												<h2>Identifying Diabetic Retinopathy with Computer Vision techniques</h2>
												<p><i>November 2023 - Present</i></p>

											<p>Under team members representing <a href="https://www.mighte.org/" target="_blank">MIGHTE</a> and Professor Mauricio Santillana's guidance, 
                                                I am working to create a tool that can identify if diabetic retinopathy exists within a vectorized image of a patients eyes.
                                                By vectorizing the data and using smaller storage space per image, the hope is to create an identifying computer vision 
                                                tool that is accessible to all.</p>

											<p>In collaboration with Jennifer Muggeo and Ledge Light Health District, this project aims to create 
                                                informative and interactive visualizations displaying drug overdose trends in the New London county area of Connecticut. The goal of this project is to communicate important insights into drug overdoses when specifically looking at factors such as race, location, and the drugs involved.
                                            These observations assisted the health department in creating informative community events 
                                            with the goal of preventing future overdoses. </p> <br>

                                                    built with the capability of applying filters, mosaicking, support for script commands,
